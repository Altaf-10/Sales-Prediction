Sales Prediction with Machine Learning

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
Forecasting sales is a difficult problem for every type of business, but it helps determine where a business should spend more on advertising and where it should cut spending.
Typically, a productâ€™s sales are primarily dependent on how much you spend on advertising it, as the more people your product reaches, the more sales will increase as long as the quality of your product is good.

 In this article, I will walk you through the task of Sales Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.
